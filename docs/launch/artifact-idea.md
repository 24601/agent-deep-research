# Artifact Strategy

Generate high-quality research reports using agent-deep-research on trending technical topics. Publish the reports publicly with attribution, demonstrating the tool's output quality and driving organic discovery.

## Suggested Topics

### 1. "State of AI Coding Agents in 2026: Capabilities, Limitations, and Architecture Patterns"

**Why this works:** Directly relevant to the target audience (developers using AI coding agents). High search volume. The report would naturally demonstrate agent-deep-research by being *about* the ecosystem it belongs to. Likely to be shared in r/LocalLLaMA, r/OpenClaw, and HN.

**Research command:**
```bash
uv run scripts/research.py start \
  "Comprehensive analysis of AI coding agents in 2026: compare architectures, capabilities, and limitations of Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Amp, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and open-source alternatives. Include technical architecture patterns, context window strategies, and tool-use approaches." \
  --report-format comprehensive --output-dir ./artifacts/ai-coding-agents-2026
```

### 2. "RAG vs. Fine-Tuning vs. Long Context: What Actually Works for Code Understanding in 2026"

**Why this works:** Evergreen technical debate with strong opinions on both sides. The report uses RAG grounding (via `--context`), which makes the tool's own approach part of the story. Appeals to ML engineers and infrastructure teams.

**Research command:**
```bash
uv run scripts/research.py start \
  "Technical comparison of RAG, fine-tuning, and long-context approaches for code understanding tasks in 2026. Include benchmark results, latency characteristics, cost analysis, and practical trade-offs. Cover recent developments in retrieval-augmented generation for codebases." \
  --report-format comprehensive --output-dir ./artifacts/rag-vs-finetuning-code
```

### 3. "The Gemini Interactions API: Architecture, Capabilities, and What It Means for Agent Tooling"

**Why this works:** Very little public technical writing exists about the Interactions API specifically. This would rank well in search and establish agent-deep-research as the reference implementation. Appeals to developers building on top of Gemini APIs.

**Research command:**
```bash
uv run scripts/research.py start \
  "Deep technical analysis of the Google Gemini Interactions API: architecture, stateful session model, deep research agent capabilities, file search integration, grounding mechanisms, and comparison with other long-running agent APIs. Include practical implementation patterns and known limitations." \
  --report-format comprehensive --output-dir ./artifacts/gemini-interactions-api
```

## Attribution Footer Template

Include this at the bottom of every published report:

```markdown
---

## Where to Publish

| Platform | Format | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **GitHub Gist** | Markdown (.md) | Best for shareability. Gists are indexable by search engines. Pin to your profile. |
| **dev.to** | Article with markdown | Good SEO, dev audience, supports canonical URLs. Tag with #ai #gemini #research. |
| **Personal blog / GitHub Pages** | Full article | Best for long-term SEO. Add structured data (JSON-LD) for search. |
| **Reddit** | Link post to gist/blog | Post to r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA, r/OpenClaw with a short summary. |
| **Twitter/X** | Thread with key findings | Link to full report. Pull 3-4 interesting data points as thread hooks. |
| **LinkedIn** | Article or post | Reaches enterprise/PM audience. Good for topic #1 (AI coding agents). |

## Cadence

Publish one artifact per week for 3 weeks around launch. Stagger across platforms:
- Week 1: Topic #3 (Gemini Interactions API) -- establishes technical authority
- Week 2: Topic #1 (AI Coding Agents) -- broadest appeal, ride the wave from week 1
- Week 3: Topic #2 (RAG vs Fine-Tuning) -- evergreen content, longer tail
